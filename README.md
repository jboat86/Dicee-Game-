# Dicee-Game-
The Dicee game was bulit with vanilla JS using a tutorial from a full-stack web development Udemy course. The aim of the game is to randomly generate numbers on twice Dice from 1-6. The randomisation feature was implemented using if/else statements. I plan to update this game by making the Dice images clickable which will change to random Dice numbers upon clicking.
